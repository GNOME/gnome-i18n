[1] Translations are for the following languages :

de,es,fr,it,ja,ko,pl,pt_BR,ru,sv,zh_CN,zh_TW

    Translations are for the following modules :

	gedit		gnome-control-center	gnome-utils
	ggv		gnome-desktop		gperfmeter
	ghex		gnome-media		nautilus
	glade		gnome-panel
	gnome-applets	gnome-session

[2] All po files should all be UTF-8 and have the appropriate CHARSET field.
    Note : We fake the PO-Revision-Date in the 1st msgstr programmatically
    because our translators don't use Emacs. Does it look ok?

[3] Msgst values in our translated files which are different than those
    in the Gnome CVS files when doing the merge overwrite the Gnome CVS msgstr
    values and comment it with : "# SUN CHANGED MESSAGE". Changes are mostly
    for Sun terminology consistency as far as I am aware. If the files are ok 
    you ought to remove the Sun comments before commiting them back into CVS.
    Mail the translation contact you have been provided with for your language
    if you wish to query any of the changes.

[4] New translations in the files are flagged with "# SUN NEW TRANSLATION".
    Again, once the files have been validated you ought to remove the comment
    before commiting them back to CVS.

[5] Pay particular attention to what is flagged as "fuzzy match". They posed
    particular problems during the file merge. This will be fixed for subsequent
    deliveries. 

[6] There are still empty msgstr values in the files needing translation.
    These are new msgstr's that have been added since we sent the files to
    translation. 

[7] We encountered a number of issues along the way with this first
    set of translations - mostly around message alignment and leverage and also
    merging the translations back. Most of these have been resolved now so 
    turnaround will be a lot faster for subsequent translations.
