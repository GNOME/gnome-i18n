   <para><po><application>Desk Guide Applet</application> helps you
    navigate all of the virtual desktops available on your system. The
    <application>X Window</application> system, working in
    hand with a piece of software called a "window manager", allows
    you to create more than one virtual desktop to organize your
    work, with different applications running on each
    desktop. Each desktop can then also be subdivided by the window
    manager into rows and columns of working space, called
    "desk areas".</po> <po><application>Desk
    Guide Applet</application> is a navigational tool to get around
    the various desktops and desk areas, providing a miniature road
    map in the GNOME panel showing all your virtual desktops (also
    known as workspaces) and desk areas, and allowing you to switch
    easily between them.</po></para>

    <para><po><application>Desk Guide Applet</application> works
    hand-in-hand with the window manager, the piece of software such
    as Sawmill or Enlightenment that handles the look and feel of your
    windows - laying down borders, resizing the windows, placing
    them, moving them and so on. The window manager is in charge of
    the various desktops. <application>Desk Guide Applet</application>
    handles the navigation.</po></para>
 
    <para><po><application>Desk Guide Applet</application> displays
    miniature versions of all your available desktops, including
    outlined boxes representing the applications running in each
    desktop window. The desktop currently in use is
    highlighted. Mouse-click on a representation of a desktop in
    <application>Desk Guide Applet</application> to switch to display
    a different virtual desktop on your monitor.</po></para>
