      How do I translate the GNOME desktop to other languages than english?
      This is a question that pops up quite frequently on the various GNOME
      mailing-lists and IRC channels. Well, this is a feeble attempt 
      at writing a guide to translating all the different parts of
      the GNOME desktop environment, and believe me there are a few
      well hidden files containing translatable strings.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      There are different opinons on what is most important
      when translating. Some think that docs are more important
      and others think that the interface, menus and dialogs
      are more important. This is something that the translator
      must decide for him/herself. I'll try to cover both here.
      My opinion is that they are both of equal importance,
      but that the menus and dialogs are the ones the user first
      meet and so these are what makes the users realize that
      the apps are really available in their own language.
      Of course there is nothing stopping you from doing both
      at once, except time and resources.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are a few other docs that contain valuable information
      for a translator such as the gettext documentation and 
      a few guides on the web. Look at <ulink
      url="http://www.gnome.org/gdp/doctable/doctable_list.php3?CategoryID=4"
      type="http">GNOME documentation project's  doctable</ulink>
      for a few pointers to other resources. Also the gettext
      documentation describes how to set up emacs to work with
      .po files in what is called po-mode. I recommend that you try
      this out. I have found it to speed up my own work considerably.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>po-files</title>
    <para>
      When the programmers insert user-visible text strings into
      the programs, they enclose them in _() or N_(). These are
      macros that gettext use to extract the strings from the source
      code and put them into a message catalog. This is placed in
      a subdirectory called po/ in the top directory of the programs'
      source code and is called for example <filename>gnome-libs.pot</filename>.
      The first thing you do when starting a new translation is to copy
      this file to XX.po where XX is your language code (specified in 
      ISO 639, which is a standard containing language codes). After
      doing this you can start translating the actual content of the file.
    </para>
    <para>
      The file contains a number of strings of the form:
        <programlisting>
          #: panel/panel_config.c:1050
          msgid "Color to use:"
          msgstr "Farge som skal brukes:"
        </programlisting>    
    </para>
    <para>
      The first line tells you which source file the string comes
      from. panel/panel_config.c at line 1050. The next is the
      original string from the .c file, and the last is the translation.
      The last line will be empty when you first copy the .pot file to
      XX.po.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now to have your translation included in the build process
      you must add the language code to <filename>configure.in</filename>
      in the ALL_LINGUAS environment variable. For readability i recommend
      you add it in alphabetical order.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="menus">
    <title>Menus and .desktop files</title>
    <para>
      The name for an application in the menu is defined in a file
      with a .desktop extension. The format of the file is as follows:
        <programlisting>
	  [Desktop Entry]
	  Name=Dia
	  Name[ja]=Dia
	  Name[no]=Dia
	  Name[pl]=Dia
	  Name[fr]=Dia
	  Comment=A Diagram Editor
	  Comment[ja]=¥À¥¤¥ä¥°¥é¥à¥¨¥Ç¥£¥¿
	  Comment[no]=Diagramredigering
	  Comment[pl]=Edytor diagramów w Gtk+ 
	  Comment[fr]=Un éditeur de diagrammes
	  Exec=dia
	  Icon=dia_gnome_icon.png
	  Terminal=0
	  Type=Application
	</programlisting>
      The first line is the name of the application in english and
      the following lines have the different translations, where the
      language is specified by [XX] where XX is the language code.
      The comment line is similar, and the text in this line shows
      up if you add a launcher for the program on the panel and position
      the pointer over the icon. Just like a tooltip for a button in a
      program.
      </para>
      <para>
        The names for the menus themselves are defined in files with a
	.directory extension. These are found in the gnome-core module
	in the directory desktop-links. Here you will also find .desktop
	files for some standard applications on a Unix machine, such as
	emacs, netscape, rxvt etc. The format is the same for the .directory
	files as for the .desktop ones.
      </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="sound">
    <title>soundlists</title>
    <para>
      In every application that has sounds for events there is a file
      with .soundlist as the extension. This file contains descriptions
      of sounds and their corresponding events. The file looks like this:
        <programlisting>
          [__section_info__]
          description=Panel
          description[ca]=Plafó
          description[es]=Panel
          description[et]=Paneel
          description[fr]=Panneau de GNOME
          description[gl]=Panel
          description[ko]=ÆÐ³Î
          description[no]=Panel
          description[pl]=Panel
          description[pt]=Painel
          description[wa]=Scriftôr

          [open]
          file=panel/slide.wav
          description=Expand
          description[ca]=Expandir
          description[es]=Expandir
          description[et]=Ilmumine
          description[fr]=Expansion
          description[gl]=Expandir
          description[ko]=³ÐÈ÷±â
          description[no]=Utvid
        </programlisting>
      The format is very similar to the .desktop and .directory files.
      The descriptions are found in the control-center (gnomecc). The section: 
      [__section_info__] tells us that the name of the program for which the
      sound events are used is next. The [open] section has the sound event for
      the [open] action on the panel (clicking the foot-menu), and the rest is
      just like the .desktop files.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="mime">
    <title>Mime-types</title>
      <para>
        The descriptions of mime-type actions are kept in files with the
        extension .mime. These files are found in some applications and
        also in the gnome-libs/gnome-data directory. The format is:
            <example>
	      <title>Sample keys with localization support</title>
	        <programlisting>
                  text/plain:
	                  open=command %f
	                  open.tag1.Do this and that=this-and-that %f
	                  [es]open.tag1.Hacer esto y aquello=this and that %f
	                  open.tag2.Gzip it=gzip %f
	                  [es]open.tag2.Comprimir con gzip=gzip %f
	                  open.tag3.Mail it=mail %{Recipient} < %f
	                  [es]open.tag3.Enviarlo por correo=mail %{Recipient} < %f
	                  open.tag4.Example=example %f
	        </programlisting>
	    </example>
      </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="other">
    <title>Other application specific files of interest</title>
      <para>
        There are a few applications that have translatable strings
        hidden in other files as well. Dia the diagram editor is one of them.
        It has strings containing descriptions of diagram objects in files
        with .sheet extensions. The format is XML and looks like this:
    </para>
    <example>
      <title>Translatable Strings</title>
      <programlisting>
<![%xml-code;[
            <sheet xmlns="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia-sheet-ns">
              <name>Chronogram</name>
              <description xml:lang="fr">Objets pour l'écriture de chronogrammes.
              </description>
              <description>Objects to design chronogram charts</description>
              <contents>
                <object name="chronogram - reference">
                  <description xml:lang="fr">Une échelle de temps</description>
                  <description>A time scale</description>
                </object>
                <object name="chronogram - line">
                  <description xml:lang="fr">Une ligne de données</description>
                  <description>A data line</description>
                </object>
              </contents>
            </sheet>
]]>
          </programlisting>
	</example>
      <para>
        There is no big difference here, just follow the lead of the existing
        translation as in this example, using your language code in xml:lang="".
      </para>
      <para>
        Another recent find used in the 1.2 version of the panel is panel.hints.
        This file contains useful hints that pop up when the panel starts up.
        It is also in XML format. Example follows:
          <programlisting>
<![%xml-code;[
             <GnomeHints>
              <Hint>
                <Content>Right click on the panel to get a menu</Content>
              </Hint>
              <Hint>
                <Content>To add an applet, right click on a panel
            then choose 'Applets', then pick an applet
            from the list</Content>
              </Hint>
              <Hint>
                <Content>To manipulate a panel applet, right click
            anywhere over the applet</Content>
                <Content xml:lang="cs">Manipulaci s aplety je mo¾no dosáhnout
            pravým tlaèítkem my¹i</Content>
               </Hint>
]]>
          </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        Here the first hint is not translated, and second one is.
        This is all very similar to the previous example and thus I
        leave the rest as an excercise for the reader. :)
      </para>
      <para>
        This is it for now. I hope someone will find this document useful
        and I can promise that it will be revised shortly and hopefully I
        will manage to keep it up-to-date as things move on.
        Cheers and thanks for your time. Let's make GNOME the most available
        desktop out there, language-wise at least.
