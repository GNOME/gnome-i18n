This is intended to be the Gnome Glossary which should be used to
reference terms for translation. The idea is to have a set of translated
terms used throughout Gnome in the glossary so translators can look it
up in order to get the reference translation for a term. This is in
order to increase the consistency in Gnome translations.

The rough procedure for translating the Glossary is:

First time translation:
1. Run csv-to-pot.sh to create a .po file for translation.
2. Translate the .po file :)

e.g.
$ ./csv-to-pot.sh GnomeGlossary.csv > mylang.po
$ favourite_editor de.po
$ cvs add de.po
$ cvs ci

You can also create a glossary.pot file and use your favourite msgfmt
tools.

E.g. for updating translations with fresh English terms when the .csv
file is updated:
$ ./csv-to-pot.sh GnomeGlossary.csv > newglossary.pot
$ msgmerge mylang.po newglossary.pot

The csv-to-pot.sh script is a little bit rough and ready so I can't
guarantee perfect .po files generated from it.
