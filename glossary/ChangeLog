	* .cvsignore: Added the "messages" file.

	* el.po: Added Greek translation.

	* xml-i18n-glossary-tool.pl: Small update, now it honors
	the glossary file parameter.

	* glossary.pot: Generated .pot file from GnomeGlossary.gnumeric
	You may use this for translations. You may regenerate with
	"perl xml-i18n-glossary-tool.pl --pot GnomeGlossary.gnumeric"

	* xml-i18n-glossary-tool.pl: Added perl script
	that extracts the terms of the GnomeGlossary.gnumeric
	file into a .po file.

	* README.glossary.tool: Added README.glossary.tool
	that describes the xml-i18n-glossary-tool.pl
	Perl script.

	* One of Sun's linguists (thanks Gabrielle) has pruned out a lot 
	of the terms. She has also filled in definitions for a lot of the
	terms too.

2000-12-20 Michael Twomey <michael.twomey@ireland.sun.com>

	* Merged in the Gnome glossary 
	(gnome-docu/user-docs/glossary/glossary.sgml). I've just cut and 
	pasted the SGML from each glossary term.
	* Pruned out some terms. I've started pruning out terms which 
	probably shouldn't be in the glossary.

2000-12-07  Gregory Leblanc  <gleblanc@cu-portland.edu>

	* Added this directory to keep the glossary for GNOME Translations,
	and related files.  Please be sure to commit the UN-COMPRESSED
	version of the gnumeric spreadsheet, so that proper diffs can be
	maintained.
