<p>Last saturday we thought about setting up some kind of planet GNOME-NL. And now, (drumroll please), here it is:<p>

<h4><a href="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/archives/2005/04/05/desktop-places-nautilus/">Desktop Places, Nautilus</a></h4>
<p>
<p><p>Finally my exams week is over, good results so I look forward to the end of this college year.</p></p>

	<p><p><h4>Desktop Places</h4>I&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://live.gnome.org/DesktopPlaces">wiki page</a> on live.gnome.org after some discussion with seb128 on <span class="caps">IRC</span>. I think (and I hope more people) we need a central way of modifing, adding and fetching all the standard desktop places we have like Home, Trash etc. This is closely related to gtk-bookmarks, which also relates to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/RecentFilesAndBookmarks">this wiki page</a>.</p></p>

	<p><p><h4>File management stuff</h4>Now I&#8217;m at it, lets go on with some ideas. It would really rock if we could move some parts of libnautilus-private (like file management operations) to another public library. This way other apps can integrate with nautilus which will give a consistent feeling for the user. (Think about the same progress window in every app)</p></p>

	<p><p><h4>Halfish boredom</h4><a href="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/wp-content/images/gnome-mysql.png"><img src="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/wp-content/images/gnome-mysql_thumb.png" class="left"></a>So I was a little bored today and decided to get my mind of the usual stuff and relax a bit with some python hacking. Since I need to examine/edit and add a lot of data into a MySQL database in the near future for my job I&#8217;ve hacked together a little utility to do database management tasks.<br>

OOPS! Being the irregular blogger I am, I forgot to post some photos from the gnome-nl gnome 2.10 release party. I think most people there agreed that we should do something like that more often, and I got told that I promised to try to organise a "pub-evening" (I would use 'borrel' in Dutch, dunno what to use in English) each month.

<p>
So i finally got my mac mini about 2 weeks ago (after 6 weeks of waiting), but i haven't been able to use it since i:<br>a) refuse to use it with 256 mb RAM<br>b) i bought a 1 gb DIMM which was broken, got it changed for another one, which doesn't appear to be broken but my mac mini is not stable at all.<br>Which basically means i get to get some other brand (when i finally have time to do so); until then my mac will be sitting in a corner.<br><br>Besides that and paid work, I have been busy creating a yearbook. Creating a yearbook basically means kicking people until they manage to deliver their content and layouting about 205 pages. It sometimes is a fun task to do, though it is tedious when you have missed the deadline for the press and some people still need to send in their content. Anyway, it fortunately is almost over, so i can concentrate on other things.<br><br>I hate continuously reminding people to do something, etc, etc. I guess that means that i should not become a manager.<br><br><center><hr width="50"></center><br><br>En als er ook maar iets irritant is, dan is het wel je OV kaart kwijt zijn.

<h4><a href="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/archives/2005/03/26/progress-dialogs-screenshot-desktop-improvements/">Progress dialogs</a></h4>
<p>
<p><p>It&#8217;s been a while, so here are some updates. I&#8217;m sorry that I broke p.g.o (again). I changed some user permissions of one article in WordPress so it decided to change all articles or something.</p></p>

	<p><p>When I was fixing bug <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159057">#159057</a> I needed to build a progress dialog for emptying the trash. I compared the Nautilus&#8217; ones with the guidelines in the <span class="caps">HIG</span> and came to the conclusion that they aren&#8217;t really following <span class="caps">HIG</span> guidelines so I created my own:</p></p>

	<p><p><img src="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/wp-content/images/emptying_trash.png" class="nothing"></p></p>

	<p><p>It would be a good idea to create a consistent dialog for trashapplet and nautilus, I&#8217;ve opened a bugreport for it <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171694">here</a>.<br>
The current nautilus progress dialog looks like:</p></p>

	<p><p><img src="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/wp-content/images/naut_trash.png" class="nothing"></p></p>

	<p><p>Been thinking about and discussing some desktop improvements a bit in #gnome-nl. I&#8217;ve come up with <a href="http://geeklog.eyesopened.nl/index.php/ramblings/">a list</a> which I think are nice improvements for the desktop. Most items aren&#8217;t new. I&#8217;ll also try and work on some of them in the neir future.</p></p>

	<p><p>Oh, and to go with the flow:</p></p>

<b>Totem Mozilla Embedding</b><br>
Bastien already said that we had basic javascript functionality people working in the Totem-Mozilla plugin. Today, I finished the second part of the job: a two-way communication protocol. Should ideally use DBUS for that, but we're using something of ourselves right now.
<p>
The result of that is that the plugin and the child application (which is spawned on its own for security reasons) interact using some basic IPC command-set. This, in combination with the javascript-functionality, means that I can click images on a <a href="http://ronald.bitfreak.net/priv/pimp.png">HTML page</a> and the player will react as it should. The javascript-calls are compatible with Quicktime Player. Woohoo, finally a kick-ass mozilla media player. :-). Get your daily dose of Totem-CVS today!</p>

<b>MP4 authoring</b><br>
After Jon's release of pyMusique, I felt the strong need to get my hands on a working MPEG-4 ISO muxer (for GStreamer). Reasons are simple:
<ul>
<li>Writing tags to music downloaded from iTMS (yes, they're untagged!).
<li>Capture MPEG-4 video/audio in a MPEG-4 container using Cupid.
<li>Transcoding my Ogg/Vorbis files to MPEG-4 so I can transfer them to my iPod.
</ul>
And so I did. GStreamer can now write full-spec MPEG-4 files. <a href="http://ronald.bitfreak.net/priv/mp4.jpg">Screenshot</a>. Tested with all of the above use cases. (3) can be done using gst-launch, tags are conserved. (2) just works. Jon is adding support for (1) right now. Get your daily dose of GStreamer CVS right now!</p>

<h4><a href="http://uwog.net/blog/?p=39">Moderation and Helpfulness</a></h4>
<p>
<p><b>Blog Comments</b><br>
For some reason, all comments to my blog needed moderation (didn&#8217;t I turn that off? no I did not, but there is another slightly obscure &#8220;Comment author must have a previously approved comment&#8221; option); I just figured people had dumped me en masse on their /ignore list, until I looked a bit better in the WordPress Admin. Now people can happily chat with me again, sorry! I&#8217;ll approve all non-spam comments immediately.</p>
	<p><b>Fedora Extras</b><br>
In other news, I did my first steps in the World of Fedora Extras Package Building. Immediately ran into some problems due to me being new to the process and the big flux RawHide is in now. Fortunately, the guys from Red Hat and #fedora-devel were really helpful in getting me going. Quite unexpected, as I figured most people would just be too busy with their normal Red Hat job to help some n00b volunteer. Thanks!</p>
	<p><b>MS Word</b><br>
Apparently, some Word developers <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2005/03/13/394808.aspx">read planet.gnome.org as well</a>. Welcome, I&#8217;d say! Now while I&#8217;m at it: I use MS Word occasionally myself (for some customers that expect Word documents, and to look for features that AbiWord could nicely adopt as well) and I would really love to have LaTeX math support in Word. If you have some spare time the comming weeks Rick, could you add that? Of course, I&#8217;d be willing to add it myself, if Word was GPLed :-)</p>
	<p><b>Dutch GNOME 2.10 release notes</b><br>
Since we&#8217;re in a cheery mood, and someone on my blog told me to <a href="http://uwog.net/blog/?p=34#comment-2125">quit whining</a> a few days back (yay for blog comments :), we&#8217;re now working on fixing the Dutch GNOME 2.10 release notes translations.

<h4><a href="http://uwog.net/blog/?p=38">How to spend your spare time</a></h4>
<p>
<p><em>Note: this entry is not intended to just bash Eugina, nor is it directed *only* at her. Her article was merely the cause that made me write this entry to address a more general problem. A problem that I see happening all the time: users often have the wrong expectations about OSS and the development process involved. We wrote a short <a href="http://www.abisource.com/support/expectations.phtml">essay</a> about this as well a while ago.</em></p>
	<p>@Eugenia: If you (read: if users&#8230;) want to be able to <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9933">dictate</a> what developers should or should not implement, then by all means, go ask commercial developers to implement it for you. They like to be told what to do, as customers are their only hope for survival (some cash might help speed up the process). Unbound OSS developers (ie. not working for any company) can do with <em>their spare time</em> whatever they want. No really. Their spare time. Try to remember that. Write it 1000 times on the wall: &#8220;Noone can dictate how people should spend <em>their spare time</em>&#8220;. Some developers love talking to users. Some don&#8217;t. There is nothing you can change about that. If you don&#8217;t like that, then you don&#8217;t have any other option then to start your own software movement where users can dictate what developers should do. I think such a movement would flourish!</p>
	<p>Oh, and this may come as a surprise to some: OSS is not about killing CompanyA or being more competitive than ProductX. Often developers just enjoy writing good code or being part of a community. Heck, all too often have I been told that I should quit AbiWord development and join the OpenOffice.org team. Because clearly, OpenOffice.org is the only viable competitor against MS Word. Well, *I don&#8217;t care*!  I have fun hacking and maintaining AbiWord and I greatly enjoy the community surrounding AbiWord. I don&#8217;t enjoy working on OpenOffice.org. Too bad if people don&#8217;t like the way I spend my spare time.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://uwog.net/blog/?p=37">How not to organize release note translations</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Being part of GNOME-NL, I myself together with the whole team spent a large amout of time translating the GNOME 2.10 release notes into Dutch, including some nice Dutch screenshots. We figured it would be really nice for novice (potential) users to be able to read all the goodness in their own languages.<br>
Now, this is where the mess begins. Not only were the official release notes continuously changed until the very last moment (note: bad), the process of creating the latest and the greatest .po file was a mess as well. Murray was as helpful as he could be, suggesting we needed gnome-doc-utils CVS HEAD (note: bad). When the final 2.10 release was made, we generated the HTML ourselves to host them on <a href="http://nl.gnome.org">http://nl.gnome.org</a>, which looked fine. However, the Dutch release notes linked on <a href="http://gnome.org">http://gnome.org/</a> were still partially in English! Whuh? Murray told us to follow the instructions in the &#8220;releng&#8221; module to get a proper .po file, which we did, but to no avail. There seems no way to get a .po file that <em>is</em> correct, so we are left in the dark (note: bad) now. Additionally, we noticed today that the (partial) Dutch translation was <em>dropped altogether</em> from gnome.org, without any notice (note: really really bad)!<br>
We&#8217;re very keen on giving a perfect experience to (potential) Dutch GNOME users, hence our <a href="http://l10n-status.gnome.org/gnome-2.10/top.html">high ranking</a> in the overall GNOME translation list with just 3 fuzzy strings left. However, this whole release notes translation experience is just so demotivating, that I doubt I&#8217;ll spend my time on it next time.</p>
	<p><em>Note: I do love the effort a lot of people have put into making localized release notes possible, but currently, it is just not working</em></p></p>

It's kinda evil, but hey, why not? All poor packagers are busy already, so let's give them some more work. I've released <a href="http://ronald.bitfreak.net/me/cupid.php">Cupid 0.0.2</a>, which is a GStreamer/GNOME video-capture and -display tool, and <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/gst-ffmpeg/0.8.4.html">GStreamer-FFmpeg 0.8.4</a>, which is a set of GStreamer plugins based on the popular and high-quality ffmpeg codecs.

<p> <b>Other people release, too</b><br>
Also, one of our new GStreamer supporters, Jon Lech Johansen, released <a href="http://fuware.nanocrew.net/pymusique/">pyMusique</a> today, which is a Gtk-application that lets you buy music from the iTunes Music Store from your GNOME desktop. I'm already a happy user of this piece of software. Great work, Jon!</p>

<h4><a href="http://uwog.net/blog/?p=36">AbiWord Won&#8217;t Fall for Feature Bloat</a></h4>
<p>
<p><a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/index.cgi/326">Luis</a>: First of all, that awful toolbar is for some reason how Martin likes his AbiWord. Beats me as well why anyone would like that, and I agree it could use a lot of cleanup.<br>
Then on to any possible feature bloat. This can hardly be jugded just by looking at that toolbar, as it only shows the really basic functionality users expect from every WordProcessor. That said, we are trying to be very, very careful about the features we add to AbiWord. For example, all the new stuff you&#8217;ve seen floating by the last couple of weeks (Equation/MathML/LaTeX support, Grammar checker support, etc) is all <em>completely</em> implemented in plugins. We&#8217;ve been refactoring AbiWord for this very purpose. In fact, the featureset of AbiWord 2.4 will be (without the plugins) exactly the same as the featureset of AbiWord 2.2 (ignoring the usual tweaks all over the place).<br>
As long I&#8217;m involved in AbiWord&#8217;s development, I&#8217;ll battle against any feature bloat in AbiWord&#8217;s core.</p></p>

<p>The impossible has happened. We have 100% interface translation for GNOME 2.10. This in spite of some 6000-7000 new strings alongside the normal string updates... I'd like to thank the Dutch translation team for their effort.<p>
This is a first for us, a Dutch press release. I'm very excited about this. It means we're finally coming of age as a GNOME community. Can't wait 'till tomorrow when 2.10 will be a fact!</p>

<b>European software patents</b><br>
I just heard multiple such rumours... After the EP (EU parliament) proposed to restart the directive decision-makery, after MPs (national parliaments) of many countries opposed the directive, after many citizens openly opposed the directive, after Denmark announced they would oppose the A-item, at least for the meeting this morning, after all our tries ...
<p>
... the EC (EU council) just passed the patent directive. Long live democracy. :-(.</p>

<b>GNOME 2.10 release party</b><br>
At the day of the release (Wednesday, March 9th), GNOME-nl will be organizing one of the GNOME release parties to celebrate the release of our all-beloved GNOME 2.10. See <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Gnome210Party">this page</a> for a complete list. Our party will be held in the Stairway to Heaven, which is a popular cafe close to the train station of Utrecht. All interested people are invited to come and join us from 20.00 on.
<p>
All dutch GNOME developers, translaters, contributors and enthusiasts are hereby invited to come and join us in this celebration. Don't bring your laptop, however, it's not a LAN/install party. See you wednesday!</p>

<p>Finally got around syncing my personal AbiWord-pet-branch with CVS HEAD again. You probably all know the irritating situation of having written a patch that wasn&#8217;t immediately committed (for whatever reason) or was put away in a branch, and you look at it again after 6 months. It&#8217;ll never apply in the current state, so you have to update and rework it. You always end up ignoring the problem until it&#8217;s too late. This becomes especially frustrating when the <a href="http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/2005/Mar/0082.html">patch is this big</a>. Glad I finally got around doing it.</p>
	<p>Can&#8217;t close this blog entry without a last reply to <a href="http://log.ometer.com/2005-03.html#3">Havoc</a>: first of all, it would be insanely nice if the cvs access procedures that will apply to FC Extra&#8217;s would also apply to Fedora Core!<br>
Now, on to the Gnumeric exclusion problem. I noticed desktop-backgrounds-extra is not in a seperate SRPM. There goes my additional saved 6MB. Let&#8217;s see. How about ditching the openoffice.org-* packages? That would make enough room for Abi to fit in, and Gnumeric as well! I ofcourse realize that his will never happen without a nice GNOMEy presentation application. So if anyone has written one, but just never gotten around to committing it in GNOME&#8217;s cvs, now is the time!</p>
	<p>BTW, p0rn on <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">planet.gnome.org</a>? Not that I have any particular problem with it, being Dutch and all, but I just wouldn&#8217;t file it under &#8220;Tips&#8217;n'Hacks&#8221;.</p></p>

Jakub, we went to 'Dolni Dvur' and went skiing in 'Spindleruv Mlyn' (if I spelled it correctly). If I'm right, those places are not far from Liberec. Anyway, what makes .cz attractive is that it's cheap. The beer is cheap (and good), restaurants are cheap (~EUR 60 for a good dinner for 5 persons, in the Netherlands that would cost about ~EUR 200), public transit is cheap and skiing too (equipment rent and ski passes). Also, we were told that .cz had good slopes for beginners. For us (5 students), it was a perfect place to go on holiday for a week.<br><br>[oh, i do have comments switched on and they work fine ...]</p>
