 Hi,

 This is a terminology database generator. There is a hardcoded hu.po in
 the perl script, but after changing this, the code must be reusable to
 other .pos.

 Please drop this 3 files to an empty dir. Create a cvs dir for the
 repository, make a database called term on a postgres server.

 Use gendb.sh script to generate the table memory (file, msgid, msgstr).

 It's just the generator, use the table from php (exmaple php is included
 here), or from some nice gui tool.
 
 Running example: http://www.gnome.hu/db.php

 Better to look into the code... there is no warranty.
