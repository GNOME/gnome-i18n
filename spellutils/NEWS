   can now be used unchanged in both programs.

Pospell 0.4 (2000-04-12)

Pospell 0.1 (2000-04-09)
 - The initial version. Made by editing the source of the similar
   program Newsbody 0.1.5 by the same author.

=====================

Newsbody 0.1.5 (1999-08-12)
 - newsbody.c: Some C compilers are reported not to like preceding
   white space in preprocessor lines, so the white space are removed.
 - newsbody.c: It seems that getopt() in some systems is declared
   in stdlib.h, so include both unistd.h and stdlib.h to be sure.
 - Makefile.in: Now all rules are explicit instead of implicit.

Newsbody 0.1.4 (1999-08-09)
 - configure.in: Don't compile with the -Wall and -pedantic flags
   unless using gcc.
 - lib.c: read_header(): Bugfix. next_char was erroneous declared
   as char, but should be an int.

Newsbody 0.1.3 (1999-01-30):
 - Fixed one more bug: The empty line between header and body would
   disappear in some cases.

Newsbody 0.1.2 (1999-01-29):
 - Fixed bugs that in some cases could lead to core dumps when
   handling multiline headers or signatures: The return value from
   read_line() were ignored two places.

Newsbody 0.1.1 (1999-01-17):
 - Added a man page.
 - Added the `install' target in Makefile

Newsbody 0.1.0 (1999-01-16):
 - Almost everything is rewritten. More source files.
   More and smaller functions. Prepare for new bugs!
 - Header continuation lines are now handled properly
 - New command line option -f: the called program reads and writes 
   the bodyfile on standard input and standard output
 - newsfile can be read from standard input and written to standard output
 - There is no more a limit on the maximal line length
 - %f is expended everywhere in the program arguments
 - a literal % in the program arguments can be escaped by %%

newsbody 0.0.4 (1998-05-03):
 - Fixed error in usage text
 - Bugfix patch from Aaron Schrab <aaron@schrab.com>: An empty line was
   inserted in messages without signature if called with -s.

newsbody 0.0.3 (1998-04-28):
 - New command line option -h.
