2000-07-07  Andraz Tori <andraz.tori1@guest.arnes.si>

        * allpo.pl: added escaping of doublequotes, 
          disabled Slovenian as default language,
          cleaned up the code and information about
          updated files is now correctly printed just once

2000-06-26  Andraz Tori <andraz.tori1@guest.arnes.si>

        * allpo.pl: Made script that extracts translations from 
          .desktop files into .po and stores them back later.
          That makes translating much more efficent - all 
          messages are in one place and you can use .po tools
          to manage them...

        * update.pl: How honors POTFILES.ignore's. Now ready
          as a replacement for update.sh. Please translators
          redistribute!

        * desk.pl: Did so it did not show ./ before the
          file names. Plus made the structure more bulletproof

2000-05-23  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>

        * update.pl: updte.sh ported to perl...pretty close
          to perfect...translators please test test test!!

2000-05-23  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>

        * desk.pl: Ported some of the shell command inclucion
          to perl. This fixes the problems when you have onle
          one .desktop file in your dir (+ subdirs)

          Is now also more extentable, and will soon be 100%
          pure perl. ie. no shell commands! This will be 
          followed up by a nice touch, so be ware translators!

2000-05-22  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnome.org>

          suggestions

          Quaniquus on irc, since BitchX is stupid

        * desk.pl: Added script to put in your root cvs dir.
          Then run for instance ./desk.pl da and you will get
          a list of all desktop files missing da! :)
