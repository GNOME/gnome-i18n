        * desk.pl: Did so it did not show ./ before the
          file names. Plus made the structure more bulletproof

        * update.pl: updte.sh ported to perl...pretty close
          to perfect...translators please test test test!!

2000-05-23  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>

        * desk.pl: Ported some of the shell command inclucion
          to perl. This fixes the problems when you have onle
          one .desktop file in your dir (+ subdirs)

          Is now also more extentable, and will soon be 100%
          pure perl. ie. no shell commands! This will be 
          followed up by a nice touch, so be ware translators!
