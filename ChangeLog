2001-02-16  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* extra-po/helix-gdm2 & extra-po/gdm2beta5: Removed these
		directories from here -- the original gdm2 CVS module

		  are conserved in a tarball and available on gtranslator.org.

2000-10-23  Robert Brady  <robert@suse.co.uk>

2000-07-07  Andraz Tori <andraz.tori1@guest.arnes.si>

        * allpo.pl: added escaping of doublequotes, 
          disabled Slovenian as default language,
          cleaned up the code and information about
          updated files is now correctly printed just once

2000-06-26  Andraz Tori <andraz.tori1@guest.arnes.si>

        * allpo.pl: Made script that extracts translations from 
          .desktop files into .po and stores them back later.
          That makes translating much more efficent - all 
          messages are in one place and you can use .po tools
          to manage them...

2000-05-23  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>

        * update.pl: How honors POTFILES.ignore's. Now ready

          redistribute! 

2000-05-23  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>

        * desk.pl: Did so it did not show ./ before the

2000-05-23  Kenneth Christiansen <kenneth@gnu.org>

        * desk.pl: Ported some of the shell command inclucion

          pure perl. ie. no shell commands! This will be 
          followed up by a nice touch, so be ware translators!
