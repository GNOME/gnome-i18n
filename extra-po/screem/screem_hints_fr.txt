# This is a list of tips for SCREEM.  Every time SCREEM is started a tip
# will be selected and displayed in the "Tip of the Day" dialog.
# (Just like in the GIMP)
#
# The file format is identical to the GIMP tip files
#
# - Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# - Blank lines or comments separate two tips (they are not ignored).
#   Multiple blank lines are treated as one.  If you want to have a
#   blank line in a tip, put a space or tab in it.
# - Text will appear in the dialog as it is in this file.  This is
#   done on purpose in order to have more freedom in the layout of the
#   tips than with automatic word-wrapping, but this also means that
#   you have to avoid excessively long lines in this file.
# - Tips should be concise: 3 lines or less.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The first tip should be a welcome message, because this is the
# first thing that a new user will see.
#
Bienvenue sur SCREEM !
 
Lisez, s'il vous plait, les notes de version qui sont affichées dans la fenetre d'aperçu.

You can configure the colours to be used in the syntax highlighting
in by access the Tag Colours tab under Settings->Preferences.

With inline tagging turned on pressing space while inside a tag will
popup a menu with all the valid attributes to choose from.  If you didn't
want the menu that time just keep typing and it will go away.

Drops made in the editor are inserted at the point where they are actually
dropped rather than the current cursor position.

Dragging a file from the file tree onto the editor will insert the path
of that file relative to the current page.

Dragging with the middle mouse button from the file tree onto the editor
will present a menu of options on what to do.

Right clicking in a tag will add a menu item to the popup that allows you to
add / alter the tags attributes.

Some tags, when right clicked will add an option to the popup so you can
use the "Wizard" for that tag.

Auto entity insertion will insert html entities when appropriate, eg &quot;
will be inserted instead of a ".  A & entity is acheived by typing & twice.

When moving files around via the Site file tree any links in your pages will
be automatically updated to point to the new location.

Helper applications, when executed, will take the current page in the editor,
and output the result of processing it back into the editor, acting as a
filter.

You can add/view/edit tasks that need performing on your site by using the 
site todo list button on the toolbar.

The site template editor can be used to create templates, which will create
an entire site heirachy for you when they are used in site creation, useful
if you like your sites to have a similar look/layout.

You can quickly toggle pages between using upper and lower case for tags
by using the options in the edit menu.
