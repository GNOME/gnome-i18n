"<font size=6><b>Welcome to Red Carpet!</b></font><p>Thank you for using Red "
"Carpet. From resolving package dependencies to ensuring cryptographic "
"security, Red Carpet takes the headache out of managing your GNOME desktop "
"system. Red Carpet is also an excellent way to keep on top of the latest "
"software offerings. The software available to you is organized into "
"channels; you choose the channels you want and we'll make sure they're full "
"of great programs.</p><p><font size=4><b>Subscribing to "
"Channels</b></font></p><p>Since you've just started running Red Carpet, you "
"aren't yet subscribed to any channels. On the left of the Red Carpet window "
"is the <b>Navigation Bar</b>, which allows you to access the main pages of "
"Red Carpet.</p><p>To browse available channels which you are not subscribed "
"to, click on the <b>Unsubscribed Channels</b> icon in the navigation bar. "
"After you've done that, to subscribe to a channel, click on it and click on "
"the <b>Subscribe</b> button in the bottom right corner of the main content "
"area or select <b>Subscribe</b> from the Subscriptions menu.</p><p>We "
"welcome your feedback and bug reports, either through the <a "
"href=\"http://bugzilla.ximian.com/\">Ximian Bugzilla</a>, or the Red Carpet "
"mailing list at <a "
"href=\"http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/red-carpet\">red-carpet@ximia"
