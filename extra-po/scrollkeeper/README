This directory has two files to be translated: 
	scrollkeeper.pot and  scrollkeeper_cl-C.xml

The first is the pot file, which is very simple right now :)

The second is an XML data file.  This is necessary to get the categories to
show up localized in the help browser.  For an example of what I mean here, 
check out the screenshot at:
http://bliss.uchicago.edu/gnome/nautilus_020601_da.jpg

Please localize this, renaming it to 'scrollkeeper_cl-<locale>.xml'.

Please email me whenever you have finished a translation so I can commit it to 
ScrollKeeper CVS (on SourceForge) and possibly cut a new release.

Thanks!
