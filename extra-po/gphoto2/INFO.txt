Hi,

I am handling the de.po of gphoto2 and gtkam and have somehow (more
by accident than anything else :) assumed the role of the guy for
the translation stuff.

As you probably know, gphoto2 has superseded gphoto. gphoto2 is not
a monolithic application anymore, but consists of a library with
independent frontends. There is a command line interface, the one
that "ships" with gphoto2, and gtkam is the de-facto default
graphical interface.

As of now, German and French are the only languages that gphoto2
fully supports, and gtkam is translated into Brazilian Portugese
(with gphoto2 possibly in the works). I copied to pt_BR.po to
pt_PT.po, and some native Portugese speaker should look over that.

gphoto2 CVS is at http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8874, with
the interesting modules being gphoto2 and gtkam. I'll take care of
checking in po files you send to me.

gphoto2 is in beta4 right now, with a planned release "some time in
the nearer future" (I'd guess a few weeks). I know this is not much
time, but anything is better than nothing.

Feel free to send any questions to me, 
   Colin Marquardt <colin@marquardt-home.de>.

Thanks for your attention.
