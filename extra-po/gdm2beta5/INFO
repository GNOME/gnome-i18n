RELEASE: gdm2-beta5 not in cvs yet
SEND-TO: Martin K. Petersen <mkp@mkp.net>

A new gdm2 is going to be released.

This will be used by April GNOME and Helix, since a security fault 
has been fixed. The author was without cvs access for some time and
therefore the beta5 is _NOT_ done from the gdm2 module

Therefore if you want to have the gdm in Helix GNOME translated and
April GNOME translated, please merge this pot file with the one from 
you cvs HEAD gdm2

For instance copy your HEAD <language code>.po file to this dir and run

mgsmerge <language code>.po gdm2.pot -o newfile.po

Then fix all the fuzzy's in the newfile.po and move (mv) it to 
<language code>.po
