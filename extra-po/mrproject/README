MrProject is now moved to GNOME CVS, and translations should be
checked in directly into the two MrProject modules:

libmrproject
mrproject

The version in those two modules is the new GNOME 2 version of
MrProject and a lot of the old strings don't apply directly to the new
version. Therefore we've not checked in the old po files, but prefer
that translators do this if they think it's a good idea. If you need
help or want to ask any questions, don't hesitate to send email to:

mrproject-team@codefactory.se

Thanks a lot for all your work, and best regards,
/the MrProject team
