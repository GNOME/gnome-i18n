RELEASE: gdm2-beta4 used by Helix
SEND-TO:

Helix uses a beta release of gdm2. There haven't been any release of gdm2
in quite some time and because of patches etc, it's not likely that Helix
will use a newer release or a cvs checkout. 

Therefore if you want to have the gdm in Helix GNOME translated, please
merge this pot file with the one from you cvs HEAD gdm2

For instance copy your HEAD <language code>.po file to this dir and run

mgsmerge <language code>.po gdm2.pot -o newfile.po

Then fix all the fuzzy's in the newfile.po and move (mv) it to 
<language code>.po
