GNOME TPTest is a tool for measuring the speed (bandwidth) of an
Internet connection.

It builds on the TPTEST framework, which was originally developed by
the Swedish ICT-commission, then later by the Foundation for Internet
Infrastructure, the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Swedish National
Post and Telecom Agency.
