2005-04-14 Added fetch-translation tool
	* New:	fetch-translation.
	* TODO: Add support to process-translation for po/LINGUAS (epiphany)

2004-08-13 Move to gnome-CVS
	* Move:	Move to gnome-CVS (gnome-i18n/process-translation)

2004-07-05 Release 2.0.1 "The dude abides..."
	* Fixed bug: Add a check for bc, as this isn't always installed
		     (thanks to Metin Amiroff)
	* Feature:   Added the option to keep the translation after upload.
		     Removed the FAQ-entry which describes this.
	* Feature:   Added custom upload for gnome-applets-locations.

2004-06-09 Release 2.0.0 "Don't try to fix me."
	Well, I was right the last time. This is the 2.0 release.
	It's a rock-solid release which has no outstanding bugs.

	* Fixed bug: Always autodetect zenity. It's a core component of this
		     script, so you can't turn autodetection off anymore.
		     (This fixes the bug that zenity would still be used in
		     console-mode)
	* Fixed bug: Changed "head -1" to "head -n 1" (head -1 deprecated).
		     Reported by someone who's mail I can't find anymore.
		     Credits where credits due, so please tell me...
	* Feature:   Added a README with some nice tips.
		     Thanks to Metin Amiroff.

2004-02-26 Release 1.9.4 "Yes... I have the memo."

	This should be the last one before 2.0 gets released (knock on wood).

	* Fixed bug: Made cvs.gnome.org online-check more robust. It won't
                     complain as much as it used to.
	* Fixed bug: Non-blocking editors would screw up the commit:
	             changes to configure.in wouldn't get into cvs.
		     Now, it waits until all instances of the editor
		     (owned by you) are closed, exchanging this bug 
		     with a less annoying one.
	* Fixed bug: The script now actually listens to your preference
		     when you say that it shouldn't download the
		     configure-files. How nice.
	* Fixed bug: A better detection if the uploader is equal to the
		     translator. The cvs-changelog entry is much nicer now.
	* Feature:   GLOBAL PROGRESS BAR.
		     What? Yes, you heard me. One progress bar for all files.
		     For when you have to commit multiple translation
		     files at the same time. That feature was HARD! But it's
		     there. I've already used it myself for committing the
		     files modified by GRUT (GRand Unified Translation).
	* Feature:   A split of the extra routines. You can now define
		     actions to be done after every file, and actions to be
		     done after all files have been comitted. Look for for the
		     BIG comment-blocks in the script itself (near the bottom).

2004-02-04 Third release. 1.9.3 "More features, less bugs, yadayadayada"

    I'd like to thank Metin Amiroff for helping me squash those hard to
    find bugs. It's been very VERY helpful. Thanks man!
    
    * Fixed bug: Incorrect recognition of filename. Script would bail out.
    * Fixed bug: The script will now tell you if the name is incorrect.
    * Fixed bug: Some versions of mktemp require a template.
    * Fixed bug: Removed a very ugly error message if you invoke the script
                 without any files available.
    * Feature:   You can choose not to download and check the configure.in
                 file. This saves a lot of time and bandwidth if you already
                 know that your language is in ALL_LINGUAS.
    * Feature:   Check if cvs.gnome.org can be reached. For dial-up users.
    * Feature:   Rewritten commandline-parsing, new help-text available.
    * Some minor adjustments to some error-messages and CVS-messages.
    * Changed the README somewhat to be a bit more helpful.

2004-01-06 Second release. 1.9.2
    * Fixed some very stupid bugs.
	The do_extra, other translator and display summary things didn't work.
    * Added a binary-check.
	It can be turned off, but defaults to on.
    * Added some ideas from the script of Stanislav Visnovsky.
	The alternate modulepath thing needed for gimp etc..
    * Added a chmod -x line to make the translation not-executable.
    * Fixed a very stupid bug in the "edit configure.in" part of the script.
    * Added a filename check that should have been there from the start.
    * Added a short history at the end of this file.

2003-29-12 First public release.
    The first release of what will become the 2.0 release.
    We will call it 1.9.

2000-00-00 I created the script a long time ago.
    You can still find the 1.0 series on the gnome-i18n list.
    I don't maintain it anymore. I was a set of dirty scripts.
    One did the dirty work and one displayed a nice point'n click
    interface through zenity.
    It was born out of an itch. I scratched it.
