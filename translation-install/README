Translation Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script 'translation-install' is a small utility for installing the
translation you're working on. To illustrate how it works, let me
tell you what I usually do when I encounter a string which I'm not
sure of how should be translated to fit well in the context.

 1. First thing is to fire up the program to see the string in action.

 2. Then I have a look at it, scratch me head a little and figure out
    a meaningful string which I put in the .po file. But how do I know
    whether it really is good enough?

 3. So I run the command

      translation-install

    which processes the .po file and installs it in the proper place.
    This also screws up the running program, so I exit it (I always
    forget to close it down before I install the new translation).

 4. Then I proceed to step 1 and repeat the procedure until I'm
    satisfied, at which point I add a short comment to the string to
    ensure that the next translator isn't going to wipe out my
    carefully handcrafted and well-tested string (you can add a
    comment in Emacs in po-mode by pressing '#' on a string).

So translation-install simply converts a .po file to the corresponding
binary .mo file and installs it in the system directories so the
program will use them upon next launch (actually they will pick them
up instantly, but that tends to look a bit fun so you probably want to
restart the application).

Se below for how the script works. The reason I developed the script
is that I really don't want to go through the hassle of ./configuring
each and every project whose .pot file I translate.

      
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First edit the script so the various options are set up correctly for
you. For one thing, you almost certainly want to customize
'polanguage'. It should be set to the base names of the .po files you
want to update (e.g. 'da' for Danish da.po files).

And you might want to look into the 'runprefix'. Personally I have
granted myself the privileges to run msgfmt with sudo by inserting the
line

  ole (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/msgfmt

in /etc/sudoers so I don't have to switch to super user everytime I
need to update a translation (of course you need to have sudo
installed for this to work). Be a bit careful with this though, you
might create a security hole.
  
When you're all done, copy the script to the relevant bin directory.

By the way, you need to have awk installed (but who hasn't?).


How the script works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script assumes that the current directory is a po subdirectory of
a directory, the name of which is the package to install (so running
it in 'galeon/po/' will install the file 'galeon.mo'). The
'polanguage' constant dictates which .po file is selected.

If this isn't the case, there needs to be a special exception in the
script. I've already included exceptions for

 - gnome-i18n/extra-po/*
 
 - gimp sub domains (po-libgimp, po-plug-ins etc.)

This list probably doesn't cover all of the Gnome CVS so you may have
to add your own exception (take a look at the script). If you can't
figure out how to do that, mail me and I'll do it for you. On second
thought, mail me anyway, so the exception can be included in future
versions and benefit other translators too.
