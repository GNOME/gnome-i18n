# This is v. 0.1 of translation-install.
#
# Which is a small utility for converting a .po file into the binary
# format and installing it so it can be tested. Basically a dirty hack
# (I don't know that much about shell programming anyway), but It
# Works for Me and saves me from having to ./configure every program I
# work on.

# This is prefixed to the msgfmt installation command - if you use
# sudo like me, you need to add something like

#   ole (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/msgfmt
#
# to your /etc/sudoers file:

runprefix=sudo

# Customize this to get the right installation path:

prefix=/usr

# first a handy function for getting parent directories:
#   get_parent_dir 0 = name of this directory,
#   get_parent_dir 1 = name of this directory's parent directory,
#   etc.

# we assume that the parent directory of this directory is the name of
# the package

# unfortunaly life isn't so simple so we need a bunch of hardcoded
# exceptions
