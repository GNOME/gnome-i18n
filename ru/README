What is it?
------------
It my attempt to implement ke proposals about desktop-like files.


How it work?
------------
1. we create *.desktop-like.in files with strings marked for gettext as _().
2. all these files we list in DESKTOP
3. run modified update.sh, which create <module>.desktop.pot
4. run extractor.pl. and remove some dirty files :)
    yes i know this script is the best example of worst programming style...
5. run update.sh <LL>
6. translate LL.desktop.po
7. run desktop.pl

Files:
-------
extractor.pl	-  one-time script for extracting translated strings from 'old-style'
		   desktop-like files.
update.sh       -  modified for work with DESKTOP version of kanikus script.
		   (2kanikus: it must be brushed)
desktop.pl      -  convert all LL.desktop.po and <module>.desktop.in to
		    *.desktop, *.directory etc files.
